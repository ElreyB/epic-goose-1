quotes to use:

Laura stared but did not stir,
Long’d but had no money:
The whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste
In tones as smooth as honey,
The cat-faced purr’d,
The rat-faced spoke a word
Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard

Backwards up the mossy glen
Turn'd and troop'd the goblin men,
With their shrill repeated cry,
"Come buy, come buy."

Beside the brook, along the glen,
She heard the tramp of goblin men,

Use for Away with the Goblins ending:
Took their gifts both choice and many,
Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
Pluck’d from bowers
Where summer ripens at all hours?


Page One:
Every evening, walking alongside the brook, PlayerOne would turn her head to better hear the strange song echoing out of the wooded glen. Blushing hot in the cooling evening air, PlayerTwo would try, unsuccessfully, to hide the embarrassment that the sound always made her feel, confused and unsure of where to look. The two would huddle close in the darkening light, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. "Stay close," said PlayerOne, lifting up her head to peer into the dark,
  "We must not look at goblin men,
  We must not buy their fruits:
  Who knows upon what soil they fed
  Their hungry thirsty roots?"

As if in answer, the song echoed down, encircling the girls. "Come buy, come buy," heralded the arrival of the weird parade of creatures hobbling towards them in the dying light.


Page Two:
"Don't look" cried PlayerTwo, "PlayerOne, PlayerOne. We mustn't look at goblin men!" taking care to cover her eyes so she wouldn't give in to her own curiosity. PlayerOne ignored PlayerTwo's caution and, in an excited whisper, described each odd and fantastic creature as it came into view. They were men, of a sort, most were quite small and had animal features rarely seen in those who walked on two legs. Some had tails and others pointed noses, some were plummed in feathers, others covered in quills. In their paws and hands, they carried baskets and shiny plates weighed down with brightly colored and unfamiliar fruit.

Choice for PlayerTwo What do you do: Run or Stay

Topping Quote: "Their offers should not charm us,
                Their evil gifts would harm us."

Default Choice: Run

Horrified, PlayerTwo broke and, sticking her fingers in her ears, closed her eyes and ran homeward.

Page Three:
PlayerOne, too curious to feel fear of PlayerTwo, stretched up onto her toes to better see the troop of merchantmen.
  One had a animalInput1's face,
  One animalInput5 whisked a tail,
  One tramp'd at a animalInput2's pace,
  One crawl'd like a snail,
  One like a animalInput3 prowl'd obtuse and furry,
  One like a animalInput4 tumbled hurry skurry.
The noisy assemblage slowed to a stop before PlayerOne, throwing glances between themselves and smiling at unknown brotherly pranks. As a one, they revealed their wares, placing their baskets on the green moss or hoisting heavy golden plates. Cajoling, each offered PlayerOne their wares.

Choice for PlayerOne: Speak to the Goblins or Stay Silent

Default Choice: Speak to the Goblins

Topping Quote:  "Clearer than water flow'd that juice;
                She never tasted such before,"

Politely, PlayerOne explained that she did not have any money and would not be able to purchase any of the beautiful fruit. With the luck of the sweet-toothed, the goblins suggested a different price:
"You have much wealth upon your head,
Buy from us with a hairInput curl."
She clipped a lock and paid in full, after which she, shyly at first, accepted a beautiful fruitInput. Before long, she was gorging herself on fruit globes beyond description. They were unlike anything she'd ever tasted, fruits from that unknown orchard were sweeter than honey and stronger than any wine. PlayerOne ate until her lips were sore and face sticky from the juices, never feeling the slightest sickness despite the king's portion she consumed.
Finally, not knowing if it was day or night, PlayerOne tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.

Page Five:
PlayerTwo met PlayerOne at the gate, concern making her words harsh. "Where have you been? It's much to late for anyone to be in the woods alone." PlayerTwo reminded PlayerOne of the neighbor, Jeanie/possible name3, who had dallied with the goblin men one day. Engaged to be married, she died a maid obsessed with finding the goblin men ever after.
  "Sought them by night and day,
  Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;
  Then fell with the first snow,
  While to this day no grass will grow
  Where she lies low:"
"Nevermind that," said PlayerOne, "PlayerTwo, you will not believe what I have seen!" PlayerOne told PlayerTwo of all the lovely fruit she had eaten. Even now, in the retelling, PlayerOne was still hungry for the fruit which only just now left her feeling uncomfortably full. Pitying PlayerTwo for missing the rare treat, PlayerOne promised to go the next day and bring back some of the fruit to share.

Page Six:
Rising early the next morning, PlayerOne and PlayerTwo set to their daily chores. PlayerTwo was bright and cheerful in her work, but PlayerOne was distracted, worn, and longing for nightfall. Finally, the day began to wind down just as the two went to fetch water from the reedy brook. The sunset threw shadows on the distant mountain crags, signaling the time for return to home and safety, but PlayerOne loitered and delayed. She was looking for some hint of the customary herd of figures to come racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling out of the glen, but not a single paw or whisker was to be seen.

Anxious, PlayerTwo urged:
 "O PlayerOne, come;
  I hear the fruit-call but dare not look:
  You should not loiter longer at this brook:
  Come with me home."

PlayerOne felt cold fall over her as she realized that PlayerTwo alone could hear the goblin cry, "Come by our fruits, come buy." Never again would she taste the marvelous fruit and her heart seemed to break with longing.

Page Seven:
Topping Quote:  She never caught again the goblin cry:
                "Come buy, come buy;" --
                She never spied the goblin men
                Hawking their fruits along the glen:

Home again, PlayerOne crawled to bed, but sleep would not come. Long after PlayerTwo had fallen into rest, PlayerOne lay awake, tortured with hunger and gnashing her teeth at the memory of need unfulfilled. Each night, PlayerTwo traded sleep for tears and every minute would listen for call that would never come.

One day, PlayerOne recalled the fruitInput kernel-stone, secreted in her pocket following that feverish feast. In desperation, she placed it in a little pot and watered it with her ever-flowing tears.
  "She dream'd of melons, as a traveller sees
  False waves in desert drouth
  With shade of leaf-crown'd trees,
  And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze."
No longer would PlayerOne tend to her chores or eat, her hairInput locks seemed to grey, and her days passed sitting listlessly in the chimney-nook.

Page Eight:

Topping Quote:  At twilight, halted by the brook:
                And for the first time in her life
                Began to listen and look.

PlayerTwo's heart ached for PlayerOne; her distress further increased by the now morning and night cry of the goblins' "Come buy our orchard fruits, Come buy, come buy." Finally, the day came when PlayerOne seemed to be leaving this world and PlayerTwo had to act. Pocketing her silver penny, she kissed PlayerOne and set out at twilight to find the market.
  "Laugh'd every goblin
  When they spied her peeping:
  Came towards her hobbling,
  Flying, running, leaping"
The animalInput1-faced and animalInput2-faced, animalInput3- and animalInput4-like, snail-paced in a hurry, and the animalInput5-voiced surrounded her, stretching up panniers and plates of jewel-like fruits and fruitInput unearthly delights.

Topping Quote:  Nay, take a seat with us,
                Honour and eat with us,

"Good folk," said PlayerTwo. Tossing them her silver penny, held out her apron and bid them "Give me much and many, all that my penny will buy." Unlike merchants of the human sort, the goblins did not seem keen to accept PlayerTwo's proposed exchange. Instead, they bade her to sit and eat with them as their honored guest. After all, their wondrous fruits were ripe only fleetingly and would rapidly spoil if not presently enjoyed.

Choice for PlayerTwo: Buy the Fruit/ Eat the Fruit

Default Choice: Buy the Fruit

Page Ten:

Topping quote:  Twitch'd her hair out by the roots,
                Stamp'd upon her tender feet,
                Held her hands and squeez'd their fruits
                Against her mouth to make her eat.

  "Thank you," said PlayerTwo, "But one waits at home alone for me...
If you will not sell me any of your fruits, then give me back my silver penny." The once magnanimous smiles and cajoling voices turned hard and sharp, calling her "proud" and "uncivil". Wagging tails and purring made way for tail lashing and snarls and they began to jostle her and crowd. Claws began to rake at her and tore her gown, small paws pinching her black as ink, as the horde attempted to force upon her that which they previously tried to beguile.

Having expected no less, PlayerTwo "utter'd not a word;
Would not open lip from lip
lest they should cram a mouthful in:
But laugh'd in heart to feel the drip
Of juice that syrrup'd all her face,

The torment went on and on, until the cock crowed his morning warning and, exhausted by her resistance, the goblins flung back her penny and dispersed. Some sank into the ground like worms, some dived into the brook, others flew away on the gale and the last disappeared into the distance.

Page Eleven:

Topping Quote:  For your sake I have braved the glen
                And had to do with with goblin merchant men.

Aching, limbs stinging and skin tingling, PlayerTwo snatched up her penny and tore through the forest back to PlayerOne. The sound of the penny in her pocket was the sound of triumph over the dark


Squeez'd from goblin fruits for you,
Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
