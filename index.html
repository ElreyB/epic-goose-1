            <p id="page1"><span class="firstLetter">E</span>very evening, walking alongside the brook, <span class="PlayerOne"></span> would turn her head to better hear the strange song echoing out of the wooded glen. Blushing hot in the cooling evening air, <span class="PlayerTwo"></span> would try, unsuccessfully, to hide the embarrassment that the sound always made her feel, confused and unsure of where to look. The two would huddle close in the darkening light, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. "Stay close," said <span class="PlayerOne"></span>, lifting up her head to peer into the dark, <br><br>
              "We must not look at goblin men,<br>
              We must not buy their fruits:<br>
              Who knows upon what soil they fed <br>
              Their hungry thirsty roots?"<br><br>

            As if in answer, the song echoed down, and around the girls: "Come buy," heralding the arrival of the weird parade of creatures hobbling towards them.</p>
