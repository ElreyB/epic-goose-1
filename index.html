Blushing hot in the cooling evening air, <span class="PlayerTwo"></span> would try, unsuccessfully, to hide the embarrassment that the sound always made her feel, confused and unsure of where to look. The two would huddle close in the darkening light, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. "Stay close," said <span class="PlayerOne"></span>, lifting up her head to peer into the dark, <br><br>
              "We must not look at goblin men,<br>
              We must not buy their fruits:<br>
              Who knows upon what soil they fed <br>
              Their hungry thirsty roots?"<br><br>

            As if in answer, the song echoed down, and around the girls: "Come buy," heralding the arrival of the weird parade of creatures hobbling towards them.</p>

They were men, of a sort, with animal features rarely seen in those who walked on two legs. Some had tails and others pointed noses, some were plummed in feathers, others covered in quills. In their paws and hands, they carried baskets and shiny plates weighed down with brightly colored and unfamiliar fruit.<br>

            "You have much wealth upon your head,
            Buy from us with a <span class="hairInput"></span> curl."
            She clipped a lock and paid in full, after which she, shyly at first, accepted a beautiful <span class="fruitInput"></span>. Before long, she was gorging herself on fruit globes beyond description. They were unlike anything she'd ever tasted, fruits from that unknown orchard were sweeter than honey and stronger than any wine. <span class="playerOne"></span> ate until her lips were sore and face sticky from the juices, never feeling the slightest sickness despite the sheer amount she consumed.
            Finally, with no idea as to the passage of time, she tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.</p>

Engaged to be married, she died a maid obsessed with finding the goblin men ever after.<br><br>

Finally, the day began to wind down just as the two went to fetch water from the reedy brook. The sunset threw shadows on the distant mountain crags, signaling the time for return to home and safety, but <span class="PlayerOne"></span> loitered and delayed. She was looking for some hint of the customary herd of figures to come racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling out of the glen, but not a single paw or whisker was to be seen. <br><br>

            Anxious, <span class="PlayerTwo"></span> urged:<br>
             "O <span class="PlayerOne"></span>, come; <br>
              I hear the fruit-call but dare not look:<br>
              You should not loiter longer at this brook:<br>

            <span class="PlayerOne"></span> felt cold fall over her as she realized that <span class="PlayerTwo"></span> alone could hear the goblin cry, "Come by our fruits, come buy." Never again would she taste the marvelous fruit and her heart seemed to break with longing.</p>

            One day, <span class="PlayerOne"></span> recalled the <span class="fruitInput"></span> kernel-stone, secreted in her pocket following that feverish feast. In desperation, she placed it in a little pot and watered it with her ever-flowing tears.<br><br>
