The two would huddle close as the light faded, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. <span class="human-speak">"Stay close,"</span> said <span class="PlayerOne"></span>, lifting up her head to peer into the dark,<br><br>

                Their hungry thirsty roots?"<br><br>
              </span>

            As if in answer, the song echoed down, encircling the girls: <span class="goblin-speak">"Come buy,"</span> heralding the weird parade of creatures that hobbled towards them in the dying light.</p>

In their paws and hands, they carried baskets and shiny plates weighed down with brightly colored and unfamiliar fruit.<br>

            Buy from us with a <span class="hairInput"></span> curl."
            She clipped a lock and paid in full, after which she, shyly at first, accepted a beautiful <span class="fruitInput"></span>. Before long, she was gorging herself on fruit globes beyond description. They were unlike anything she'd ever tasted, fruits from that unknown orchard were sweeter than honey and stronger than any wine. <span class="playerOne"></span> ate until her lips were sore and face sticky from the juices, never feeling the slightest sickness despite the sheer amount she consumed.
            Finally, not knowing if it was day or night, PlayerOne tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.</p>

Finally, the day began to wind down just as the two went to fetch water from the reedy brook. The sunset threw shadows on the distant mountain crags, signaling the time for return to home and safety, but <span class="playerOne"></span> loitered and delayed. She was looking for some hint of the customary herd of figures to come racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling out of the glen, but not a single paw or whisker was to be seen. <br><br>

            Anxious, <span class="playerTwo"></span> urged:<br>

If you will not sell me any of your fruits, then give me back my silver penny." The once magnanimous smiles and cajoling voices turned hard and sharp, calling her "proud" and "uncivil". Wagging tails and purring transformed into tail lashing and snarls as they began to jostle and crowd her. Claws raked at her and tore her gown, small paws pinching her black as ink, as the horde attempted to force upon her that which they previously tried to beguile.<br><br>

            The torment went on and on, until the cock crowed his morning warning and, exhausted by her resistance, the goblins flung back her penny and dispersed. Some sank into the ground like worms, some dived into the brook, others flew away on the gale and the last disappeared into the distance.</p>

              One had a <span class="animalInput1">'s</span> face, <br>
              One <span class="animalInput5"></span>whisked a tail, <br>
              One tramp'd at a <span class="animalInput2"></span>'s pace, <br>
              One crawl'd like a snail, <br>
              One like a <span class="animalInput3"></span> prowl'd obtuse and furry, <br>
              One like a <span class="animalInput4"></span> tumbled hurry skurry. <br><br>
            The noisy assemblage slowed to a stop before <span class="playerOne"></span>, throwing glances between themselves and smiling at unknown brotherly pranks. As a one, they revealed their wares, placing their baskets on the green moss or hoisting heavy golden plates. Cajoling, each offered <span class="playerOne"></span> their wares. <br>
