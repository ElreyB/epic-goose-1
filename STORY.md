quotes to use:

Laura stared but did not stir,
Long’d but had no money:
The whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste
In tones as smooth as honey,
The cat-faced purr’d,
The rat-faced spoke a word
Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard

Backwards up the mossy glen
Turn'd and troop'd the goblin men,
With their shrill repeated cry,
"Come buy, come buy."

Beside the brook, along the glen,
She heard the tramp of goblin men,

At twilight, halted by the brook:
And for the first time in her life
Began to listen and look.

Twitch'd her hair out by the roots,
Stamp'd upon her tender feet,
Held her hands and squeez'd their fruits
Against her mouth to make her eat.

Lizzie utter'd not a word;
Would not open lip from lip
lest they should cram a mouthful in:
But laugh'd in heart to feel the drip
Of juice that syrrup'd all her face,

Squeez'd from goblin fruits for you,
Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
...
For your sake I have braved the glen
And had to do with with goblin merchant men.

Use for Away with the Goblins ending:
Took their gifts both choice and many,
Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
Pluck’d from bowers
Where summer ripens at all hours?


Page One:
Every evening, walking alongside the brook, PlayerOne would turn her head to better hear the strange song echoing out of the wooded glen. Blushing hot in the cooling evening air, PlayerTwo would try, unsuccessfully, to hide the embarrassment that the sound always made her feel, confused and unsure of where to look. The two would huddle close in the darkening light, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. "Stay close," said PlayerOne, lifting up her head to peer into the dark,
  "We must not look at goblin men,
  We must not buy their fruits:
  Who knows upon what soil they fed
  Their hungry thirsty roots?"

As if in answer, the song echoed down, encircling the girls. "Come buy, come buy," heralded the arrival of the weird parade of creatures hobbling towards them in the dying light.


Page Two:
"Don't look" cried PlayerTwo, "PlayerOne, PlayerOne. We mustn't look at goblin men!" taking care to cover her eyes so she wouldn't give in to her own curiosity. PlayerOne ignored PlayerTwo's caution and, in an excited whisper, described each odd and fantastic creature as it came into view. They were men, of a sort, most were quite small and had animal features rarely seen in those who walked on two legs. Some had tails and others pointed noses, some were plummed in feathers, others covered in quills. In their paws and hands, they carried baskets and shiny plates weighed down with brightly colored and unfamiliar fruit.

Choice for PlayerTwo What do you do: Run or Stay

Topping Quote: "Their offers should not charm us,
                Their evil gifts would harm us."

Default Choice: Run

Horrified, PlayerTwo broke and, sticking her fingers in her ears, closed her eyes and ran homeward.

Page Three:
PlayerOne, too curious to feel fear of PlayerTwo, stretched up onto her toes to better see the troop of merchantmen.
  One had a animalInput1's face,
  One whisked a tail,
  One tramp'd at a animalInput2's pace,
  One crawl'd like a snail,
  One like a animalInput3 prowl'd obtuse and furry,
  One like a animalInput4 tumbled hurry skurry.
The noisy assemblage slowed to a stop before PlayerOne, throwing glances between themselves and smiling at unknown brotherly pranks. As a one, they revealed their wares, placing their baskets on the green moss or hoisting heavy golden plates. Cajoling, each offered PlayerOne their wares.

Choice for PlayerOne: Speak to the Goblins or Stay Silent

Default Choice: Speak to the Goblins

Topping Quote:  "Clearer than water flow'd that juice;
                She never tasted such before,"

Politely, PlayerOne explained that she did not have any money and would not be able to purchase any of the beautiful fruit. She could barely believe her sweet-toothed luck when the goblins stated their price:
"You have much wealth upon your head,
Buy from us with a hairInput curl."
She clipped a lock and paid in full, after which she, shyly at first, accepted a beautiful fruitInput. Before long, she was gorging herself on fruit globes beyond description. They were unlike anything she'd ever tasted, fruits from that unknown orchard were sweeter than honey and stronger than any wine. PlayerOne ate until her lips were sore and face sticky from the juices, never feeling the slightest sickness despite the sheer amount she consumed.
Finally, with no idea as to the passage of time, she tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.

Page Five:
PlayerTwo met PlayerOne at the gate, concern making her words harsh. "Where have you been? It's much to late for anyone to be in the woods alone." PlayerTwo reminded PlayerOne of the neighbor, Jeanie/possible name3, who had dallied with the goblin men one day. Engaged to be married, she died a maid obsessed with finding the goblin men ever after.
  "Sought them by night and day,
  Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;
  Then fell with the first snow,
  While to this day no grass will grow
  Where she lies low:"
"Nevermind that," said PlayerOne, "PlayerTwo, you will not believe what I have seen!" PlayerOne told PlayerTwo of all the lovely fruit she had eaten. Even now, in the retelling, PlayerOne was still hungry for the fruit which only just now left PlayerOne feeling uncomfortably full. Piting PlayerTwo for missing the treat, PlayerOne promised to go the next day and bring back some of the fruit to share.

Page Six:
Rising early the next morning, PlayerOne and PlayerTwo set to their daily chores. PlayerTwo was bright and cheerful in their work, but PlayerOne was distracted, tired, and longing for nightfall. Finally, the day began to wind down and, as was their custom, PlayerOne and PlayerTwo went to fetch water from the reedy brook.
