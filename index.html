Blushing hot in the cooling evening air, <span class="PlayerTwo"></span> would try, unsuccessfully, to hide the embarrassment that the sound always made her feel, confused and unsure of where to look. The two would huddle close in the darkening light, locking arms and whispering to each other to be brave. "Stay close," said <span class="PlayerOne"></span>, lifting up her head to peer into the dark, <br><br>
              "We must not look at goblin men,<br>
              We must not buy their fruits:<br>
              Who knows upon what soil they fed <br>
              Their hungry thirsty roots?"<br><br>

            As if in answer, the song echoed down, and around the girls: "Come buy," heralding the arrival of the weird parade of creatures hobbling towards them.</p>

            Buy from us with a <span class="hairInput"></span> curl."
            She clipped a lock and paid in full, after which she, shyly at first, accepted a beautiful <span class="fruitInput"></span>. Before long, she was gorging herself on fruit globes beyond description. They were unlike anything she'd ever tasted, fruits from that unknown orchard were sweeter than honey and stronger than any wine. <span class="playerOne"></span> ate until her lips were sore and face sticky from the juices, never feeling the slightest sickness despite the sheer amount she consumed.
            Finally, with no idea as to the passage of time, she tossed aside the empty rinds and, on an impulse, gathered up one of the seed kernels before turning for home.</p>
