quotes to use:

Backwards up the mossy glen
Turn'd and troop'd the goblin men,
With their shrill repeated cry,
"Come buy, come buy."

Beside the brook, along the glen,
She heard the tramp of goblin men,

At twilight, halted by the brook:
And for the first time in her life
Began to listen and look.

Twitch'd her hair out by the roots,
Stamp'd upon her tender feet,
Held her hands and squeez'd their fruits
Against her mouth to make her eat.

Lizzie utter'd not a word;
Would not open lip from lip
lest they should cram a mouthful in:
But laugh'd in heart to feel the drip
Of juice that syrrup'd all her face,

Squeez'd from goblin fruits for you,
Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
...
For your sake I have braved the glen
And had to do with with goblin merchant men.

  Who knows upon what soil they fed
  Their hungry thirsty roots?"

As if in answer, the song echoed down, and around the girls: "Come buy," heralding the arrival of the weird parade of creatures hobbling towards them.


Page Two:
"Don't look" cried PlayerTwo, "PlayerOne, PlayerOne. We mustn't look at goblin men!" covering her eyes so she wouldn't give in to her own curiosity. PlayerOne ignored PlayerTwo's caution and described in an excited whisper each odd and fantastic creature as it came into view. They were men, of a sort, with animal features rarely seen in those who walked on two legs. Some had tails and others pointed noses, some were plummed in feathers, others covered in quills. In their paws and hands, they carried baskets and shiny plates weighed down with brightly colored and unfamiliar fruit.
What do you do: Run or Stay

Horrified, PlayerTwo broke and, sticking her fingers in her ears, closed her eyes and ran.
  "Their offers should not charm us,
  Their evil gifts would harm us."
